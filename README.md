# AI Coding Chrome Extention

Partially taken from [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJhlMn2otxA).



## SnapStash

The extention name is `SnapStash`. Everything was generated using GPT + Aider. Even the icons were generated by DALL-E and this README was generated (partially) by GPT 4o-mini.

## How to Test Chrome Extension directly in Chrome!

To test your Chrome extension, follow these steps:

1. Open Chrome and go to the Extensions page:
   1. -Type `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar and press Enter.
2. Enable Developer Mode:
   1. In the top right corner of the Extensions page, toggle the "Developer mode" switch to the "on" position.
3. Load your unpacked extension:
   1. Click the "Load unpacked" button.
   2. In the file dialog that opens, navigate to the directory containing your extension files (where manifest.json is
    located) and select it.
4. Test the extension:
   1. Once loaded, you should see your extension's icon in the Chrome toolbar. Optionally you can pin the extention to have better access for testing.
   2. Click the icon to open the popup and test its functionality, such as saving URLs and displaying the shopping list.

If you encounter any issues, make sure all file paths in manifest.json are correct and that all required files are present
in the directory

At this point you can leave the extention loaded and keep iterating the functionality and design!
